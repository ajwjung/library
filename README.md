# Library App

## Objective

To test understanding of objects and object constructors by creating a small library app. Full project details can be found at [The Odin Project's page](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-library).

### Specifications

**Requirements**

1. All book objects should be stored in a simple array

2. New books objects should be created using a `Book` constructor

3. Use a function to loop through the array and display each book on the page
    * The display can be a table or "cards"

4. Add a "NEW BOOK" button that brings up a form allowing users to input details for the book (title, author, number of pages, and whether it's been read)

5. Add a button on each book's display to remove the book from the library

6. Add a button on each book's display to change its `read` status
    * Create a function that toggles a book's `read` status on the `Book` prototype instance

**Note:** At this stage, we are not required to add any type of storage.
